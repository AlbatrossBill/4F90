- [x] Step 1: Create a class Foo with some private and public variable, pretend do not knowing anything. Using .getClass() method to get all the variable and its' value. In another hand, using Class class to get the elements which in class Foo.

- [x] Step 2: Pretend I only know the name of the class, the names of the field and values for each filed. Creating an object of the class Foo with those values. In another hand, using reflection. No new.. is used!!(new Foo())

- [x] Step 3: Making a new super class FooBase, it's subclass is Foo. Moving some variable from Foo to FooBase. Writing a method called getAllFields(Class clazz), in order to get all the fields that exists in both Foo and FooBase. You can use .getSuperClass() method.
